# **Assignment: AWS Route53 Clone** 

## **Objective** 

Build a functional clone of the AWS Route53 web application with persistent storage and a backend API. The focus is on recreating the Route53 user experience and core workflows rather than implementing actual DNS functionality. 

**Note: Your application should match the original application in terms of UI and UX, look and feel should be exactly the same.** 

## **Tech Stack** 

**Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript) 

**Backend:** FastAPI 

**Database:** SQLite 

## **Scope** 

#### **Authentication** 

Implement a simple mocked authentication system. 

- Login 

- Logout 

- Session persistence 

IAM, AWS Accounts, Organizations, Billing, and other AWS dependencies can be mocked. 

#### **Hosted Zones** 

Implement full CRUD functionality for Hosted Zones. 

Users should be able to: 

- View Hosted Zones 

- Search Hosted Zones 

- Create Hosted Zones 

- Edit Hosted Zones 

- Delete Hosted Zones 

All data must persist in SQLite. 

#### **DNS Records** 

Implement full CRUD functionality for DNS Records within a Hosted Zone. 

Support common Route53 record types such as: 

- A 

- AAAA 

- CNAME 

- TXT 

- MX 

- NS 

- PTR 

- SRV 

- CAA 

Users should be able to: 

- View Records 

- Search Records 

- Create Records 

- Edit Records 

- Delete Records 

All data must persist in SQLite. 

#### **Route53 Experience** 

The application should closely resemble the AWS Route53 experience, including: 

- Navigation structure 

- Hosted Zone management 

- DNS Record management 

- Tables 

- Forms 

- Search 

- Filters 

- Pagination 

- Modals 

- Notifications 

The goal is to make the application feel like Route53 rather than a generic CRUD application. 

#### **Mocked Sections** 

The following sections can be present as placeholders: 

- Dashboard 

- Traffic Policies 

- Health Checks 

- Resolver 

- Profiles 

A simple "Coming Soon" page is sufficient. 

## **Bonus (Optional)** 

- Import DNS records from BIND zone files 

- Export Hosted Zones as JSON or BIND format 

- Dark Mode 

- Keyboard Shortcuts 

- Bulk Operations 

## **Deliverables** 

#### **Source Code** 

GitHub repository containing: 

- frontend/ 

- backend/ 

#### **Documentation** 

README containing: 

- Setup instructions 

- Architecture overview 

- Database schema 

● API overview 

### **Demo:** A hosted working link 

## **Evaluation Criteria** 

- UI similarity to Route53 

- Frontend engineering quality 

- Backend/API design 

- Database design 

- Code quality and maintainability 

- Documentation 

- Overall completeness
